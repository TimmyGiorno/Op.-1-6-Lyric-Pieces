### About the repository and files

All the files in this repository are `.mscz` files. You can use `MuseScore3` to open them and save them as playable music files. Opening with `MuseScore4` is possible, but the resulting cache file will not allow you to open it with MuseScore3. Also, I use `MuseScore3` for composing. For high fidelity, I recommend that you use `MuseScore3` for listen.

You can use Acrobat to export the PDF scores for better textures.
